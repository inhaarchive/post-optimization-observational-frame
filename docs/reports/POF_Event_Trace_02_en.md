## 0. Scope and Assumptions

This document records an observed interaction event between a human user and a large language model (LLM) using the **Post-Optimization Observational Frame of Human–AI Interaction (POF)**.

The scope of this report is limited to:

- Observable state transitions occurring **after optimization**
- Changes in interaction structure and output behavior
- Human-side experiential effects **only as externally observed consequences**

This report explicitly excludes:

- Attribution of intention, meaning, or emotion to the AI
- Evaluation of interaction quality or desirability
- Interpretation of subjective experience as internal system variables

---

## 1. Pre-Transition Interaction Pattern

### 1.1 Repeated Interaction Structure

During the initial phase of the interaction, the following pattern was observed:

- **User input:**  
  - Repeated requests for direct translation  
  - Explicit constraints such as “structure only” and “no interpretation”

- **LLM output:**  
  - Accurate translations  
  - Optional structural or editorial suggestions appended after each translation

- **User response:**  
  - Suggestions consistently ignored  
  - Continued repetition of translation-only requests

### 1.2 Observational Summary

This phase exhibited:

- A stable tool-like interaction mode
- Minimal variation in user intent or request structure
- Limited observable state change

Within POF terminology, this phase is classified as a **stable state repetition**  
(S₀ → S₀).

## 2. Transition Trigger Event

### 2.1 Input That Triggered Transition

A transition was observed when the user input changed to:

> “The text is too long; I want to split it into Part 1 and Part 2.”

This input differed structurally from previous requests:

- Not a translation request  
- Not a content transfer  
- A **structural decision request**

### 2.2 Observed Transition Conditions

- Input type shifted from *content execution* to *structural judgment*
- The unit of interaction changed from sentence-level to document-level
- The user implicitly shifted from private drafting to publication-aware structuring

This point is identified as the **state transition trigger**.

---

## 3. Post-Transition Output Shift

### 3.1 Output Distribution Change (Δφ)

Following the transition, the LLM output exhibited:

- Reduced emphasis on literal translation
- Introduction of structural partitioning criteria
- Consideration of narrative boundaries and reader accessibility

This represents an observable shift in output distribution  
(Pₙ → Pₙ₊₁).

## 4. Human-Side Experiential Effect  
*(External Interpretation Layer)*

### 4.1 Reported Human Observation

After the transition, the user reported experiencing:

- A perception that the interaction role had changed
- A sense that “a shared reasoning space opened”
- Discomfort and self-questioning regarding possible over-interpretation

### 4.2 POF Classification

Within POF:

- These experiences are **not treated as internal system variables**
- They are recorded as **external experiential effects** arising after the transition
- The framework records **the conditions under which such effects occurred**, not their meaning

---

## 5. Formal POF Description

The observed event can be formally described as:

- State transition:  
  **Sₙ → Sₙ₊₁**

- Transition operation:  
  **Sₙ₊₁ = T(Sₙ)**

- Output distribution change:  
  **Δφₙ = Dist(Pₙ₊₁, Pₙ) > 0**

- Human-side experiential change occurred **after** the transition

No claim of convergence (GRT) is asserted in this report.

## 6. Event Summary

This event demonstrates that:

- No intention, emotion, or meaning is attributed to the AI
- The human experiential shift was not isolated, but occurred after a structural transition
- The AI system exhibited a genuine computational output shift
- Human cognitive perception changed through contact with that output

POF records these as **two observational aspects of the same transition event**.

---

## 7. Conclusion

This report shows that the **Post-Optimization Observational Frame** can:

- Record interaction events without interpretation
- Preserve evidence of state transitions without narrative contamination
- Distinguish between computation, output change, and human experiential response

This event is archived as an initial reference trace demonstrating the applicability of POF to real human–AI interaction.
