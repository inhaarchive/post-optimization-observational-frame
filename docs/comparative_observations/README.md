# Comparative Observations

This directory contains comparative observation documents written from the perspective of the **Post-Optimization Observational Frame of Human–AI Interaction (POF)**.

The purpose of this folder is **not** to define POF itself, nor to establish external frameworks as primary references.  
Instead, the documents here examine how other research frameworks and studies can be *observed*, *positioned*, or *re-described* when viewed through the POF coordinate system.

## Scope

Documents in this directory:
- Do **not** serve as foundational definitions of POF  
- Do **not** function as validation or refutation of external research  
- Do **not** assume causal explanations or internal mental states  

They are written strictly as **observational comparisons**, focusing on:
- Differences in observational scope  
- Differences in what is recorded vs. what is inferred  
- Differences in how interaction, transition, and collaboration are framed  

## Role within the Repository

- **README.md (root)**  
  Declares the existence and purpose of the POF framework and links to its fixed reference (OSF).

- **docs/reports/**  
  Contains concrete event traces recorded using the POF observational structure.

- **docs/comparative_observations/** (this directory)  
  Contains comparative analyses that situate external frameworks relative to POF, without elevating them to reference status.

## Notes

Comparative documents are treated as *secondary observational materials*.  
They are included to clarify boundaries, prevent misalignment, and document interpretive differences — not to establish dependency.

POF remains fully defined independently of the materials stored here.
